# Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I don't create because I need to, I create because I *have* to.  
There's an overwhelming voice in my head that says, "what if you tried this?" â€” and I do.  

That leads to something cool sometimes.  
That leads to nothing sometimes.  
But I learn every time.  

When I joined GitHub in 2024, I wasn't trying to impress anyone.  
I was fire, uploading half-baked ideas, broken code, and random experiments.  
So yeah, I have 40 repos.  
Some of them mean nothing.  
Some of them are just sparks.  

But every line of code, every broken build, every README that no one will ever read â€” it means something **to me**.

This is not a rÃ©sumÃ©.  
This is a record of curiosity.  
This is the story of someone who kept trying, even when it didn't matter to anyone else.  

I'm not here to be perfect.  
I'm here to explore.

â€” Goldfelty
