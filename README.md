I build things not because I have to, but because I *need* to.  
There’s a voice in my head that says, “what if you tried this?” — and I follow it.

Sometimes that leads to something cool.  
Sometimes it leads nowhere.  
But I always learn something.

When I joined GitHub in 2024, I wasn’t trying to impress anyone.  
I was just messing around — uploading half-finished ideas, broken code, and random experiments.  
So yeah, I’ve got 40 repos.  
Some of them mean nothing.  
Some of them are just sparks.

But every line of code, every failed build, every README that no one will read — it all means something **to me**.

This isn’t a resume.  
It’s a record of curiosity.  
It’s the story of someone who kept trying, even when it didn’t matter to anyone else.

I’m not here to be perfect.  
I’m here to explore.
